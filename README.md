# Hangman
This project is similar to the classic game "Hangman". Hangman is where someone picks a word secretly and the other 
players attempt to guess what word was chose one letter at a time.

# Motivation
I made this games as part of an assignment for the bootcamp I attend. I chose Hangman because it is a simple game I
played as a child and it has room for implementation of many cool features. Although the concept of the game is simple I 
thought it would be a great chance to show my capabilies while also challenging myself by adding some features.
